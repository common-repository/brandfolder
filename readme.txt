### Features of the Brandfolder WordPress plugin

* Easily embed your Brandfolder using our Popup Embed on any widget, menu bar, page, or post.
* The Brandfolder integration allows you to quickly grab assets from your Brandfolders to be used in Pages/Posts.
* Use the [Brandfolder] shortcode in either widgets, pages, or posts to quickly create a Popup Embed link: `[Brandfolder id="mapmyfitness" collection="mapmyrun" query="" text="View our Brandfolder" classes="brandfolder"]`
